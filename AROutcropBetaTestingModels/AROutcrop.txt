VanHiseRock.usdz	Van Hise Rock	VanHiseRock.png	10	Overlay	43.489	-89.916	"Van Hise Rock is an outcrop of Baraboo Quartzite exposed in Ableman's Gorge near Rock Springs, WI. This classic exposure not only captures the near-vertical nature of the north limb of the regional Baraboo Syncline, but also illustrates the cleavage refraction that occurs between the competent quartzite (light color) and the more incompetent phyllite (dark color) due to shear between the rock layers."
CaglesMill.usdz	Cagle's Mill	NA	NA	Plane	39.481	-86.915	The Cagle’s Mill spillway outcrop exposes Kansan and Illinoisan glacial deposits underlain by a stacked sequence of sandstone channels with interbedded shale layers of the Early Pennsylvanian Mansfield Formation.  A large channel cuts through the exposure and contains sedimentary layers consistent with a meander cut-off forming an ox-bow lake.
